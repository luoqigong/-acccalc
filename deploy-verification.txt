Deploy Verification File
=======================

Last Updated: 2025-07-01 03:15:22  
Changes Made: Headers RegExp Patterns Fixed + Vercel Config Finalized

Files Modified:
- index.html: Privacy Policy link changed from /privacy to privacy.html
- privacy.html: Internal Privacy Policy link changed from /privacy to privacy.html  
- vercel.json: Fixed configuration conflict (routes → rewrites) + Headers RegExp patterns
- package.json: Fixed Node.js version (>=16.0.0 → 18.x)

Vercel Configuration Fix:
- BEFORE: Used both "routes" and "cleanUrls/headers" (conflict)
- AFTER: Removed "routes", using "rewrites" instead (compatible)

Headers RegExp Fix:
- BEFORE: Invalid patterns like "/(.*\\.(css|js|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg))" and "/css/**" 
- AFTER: Valid RegExp patterns "/css/(.*)", "/js/(.*)", "/(.*)\\.(?:png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg)$"

Expected Results:
- No more Vercel configuration errors
- No more Node.js version warnings  
- Privacy Policy accessible via both /privacy and privacy.html
- All security headers and caching work correctly
- Clean URLs and no trailing slashes enforced

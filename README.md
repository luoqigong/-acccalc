## 🎓 How to Calculate Acceleration

### Method 1: Using Velocity Change
```
Formula: a = (v - v₀) / t
Where:
- a = acceleration (m/s²)
- v = final velocity (m/s)
- v₀ = initial velocity (m/s)  
- t = time (s)
```

### Method 2: Using Distance and Time
```
Formula: a = 2(s - v₀t) / t²
Where:
- a = acceleration (m/s²)
- s = displacement (m)
- v₀ = initial velocity (m/s)
- t = time (s)
```

### Method 3: Using Force and Mass
```
Formula: a = F / m
Where:
- a = acceleration (m/s²)
- F = net force (N)
- m = mass (kg)
```

## 🌟 Example Calculations

### Car Acceleration
**Problem**: A car accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 6 seconds. What's the acceleration?

**Solution**: 
- Convert 60 mph to m/s: 60 × 0.447 = 26.8 m/s
- Apply formula: a = (26.8 - 0) / 6 = 4.47 m/s²

### Falling Object
**Problem**: An apple falls from rest. What's its acceleration?

**Solution**: 
- Use gravitational acceleration: a = 9.8 m/s² (downward)
